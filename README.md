# Analog Project: Theremin
# Course: Semester 3 - EN2091 Analog Project

This project involved designing and building a Theremin, an electronic musical instrument, as part of the EN2091 Analog Project coursework.

My Contributions
1. PCB Design
Designed the Main Theremin PCB and Power Supply PCB using Altium Designer.
Collaborated with JLCPCB for PCB manufacturing.
2. Enclosure Design
Supported the design of the enclosure to ensure proper housing for the PCBs and components.
3. Custom Footprint Creation
Encountered inaccuracies in the 3D model and footprint of the volume control potentiometer from SnapEDA.
Created a custom footprint for the potentiometer using its datasheet, ensuring precision and compatibility.
Successfully tested and validated the custom footprint in the final design.


This project strengthened my skills in PCB design, custom component creation, and collaborative hardware development
